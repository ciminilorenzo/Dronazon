# Distributed Systems Course Project
Dronazon has a fleet of drones distributed within a smart city to handle deliveries. These drones need to be organized to select a master drone. Each time a customer places a new order, this information is passed to the master drone of the smart city, which then determines which drone will handle the delivery.

Each drone is equipped with a sensor that detects air pollution levels. Additionally, each delivery consumes battery power. When a droneâ€™s battery level falls below 15%, it must leave the system. Drones periodically communicate with a remote server, called the Administrator Server, reporting information about the number of deliveries made, kilometers traveled, air pollution levels detected, and remaining battery life. Administrators at Dronazon can monitor the delivery system through the Administrator Server, which also allows for the registration and removal of drones from the system dynamically.
